# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This EDA explores the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) from 1970 to 2017.
The dataset contains over 180,000 terrorist attacks.It imports necessary libraries for data manipulation and enhancement and visualization.
It uses numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib  for conducting EDA.
It loads the dataset as csv file and then explores the data using head(),tail(),shape,describe(),columns,nunique().
It then preprocesses the data by handling missing values and turning categorical variables by one hot encoded to prepare for data analysis.
The code uses following visualization techniques to explore the data.
A bar chart showing the country that faced the most attacks each year.
A countplot displaying the number of attacks per region with a hue for success.
Time series analysis for number of attacks over time.
A pie chart illustrating the distribution of terrorist attack types.
A bar chart showing the total number of attacks for different attack types.
A countplot exploring the relationship between target types and attack types.
A heatmap of the correlation matrix to visualize relationships between numerical variables.
Thus the code helps in identifying trendsover time, regional patterns, and the distribution of attack types.
